=head2 NAME

Dist::HomeDir

=head2 SUMMARY

    use Dist::HomeDir;
    my $dist_home = Dist::Homedir::dist_home(); # A Path::Tiny object of the Dist home

    use Dist::HomeDir lib => [qw( script/lib t/lib )];
    # @INC now contains $dist_home->child('script/lib') and t/lib

Easily find the dist homedir for an application set up as a cpan(ish)
distribution but intended to be deployed via git checkout or by a tarball
in a self contained directory.  You can also optionally modify @INC as
documented above.

DO NOT use this in code that is B<ever> likely to be installed via cpan
or other package manager.

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This module was inspired by Catalyst::Utils->home() to obtain the root
directory for obtaining application code and self-contained support data in
directories relative to the distribution root.  It does this by returning a
L< Path::Tiny > object which has a very nice interface.  However
Catalyst::Utils->home only works for perl classes.  This works for class
files and perl scripts via examining C< (caller)[1] > and thus should
B<never> be used in code that will be instaled via a cpan client or other
package manager.

Sometimes support libaries will also live in the C<t/lib> directory and the
C<script/lib> directory.  C< dist_home > will ignore these C< lib > directories
as part of finding the distribution root.  Future versions of this module
may make the list of what directories to ignore other C< lib > sub directories
user-configurable (patches welcome).

If you want to modify C<@INC> with the import syntax in the second example
in the summary, be careful.  In particular if you use L< Dist::HomeDir> in
test files and in code to be used in production, C<@INC> might be modified in
unexpeted ways depending on the structure of your codebase.


=head2 FUNCTIONS

dist_home

Returns a L<Path::Tiny> object of where the current code file executed
thinks the distribution home directory is.


=head2 ALTERNATIVES

L<Mojo::Home> - lots of features, no non-core perl dependencies

L<FindBin>    - perl core, comes with gotchas if called multiple times.

L<Test::InDistDir> - where the import syntax for L<Dist::HomeDir> came from.
